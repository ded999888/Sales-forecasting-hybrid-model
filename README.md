# Sales-forecasting-hybrid-model
This project presents a hybrid machine learning approach to sales forecasting. The objective was to improve demand prediction accuracy by incorporating controllable business drivers into the forecasting model.
Multi-Factor Sales Forecasting. Hybrid LSTM + Random Forest Model

The solution integrates:
•	Price dynamics
•	Promotion activity
•	Seasonality
•	Holiday effects

Business Context
Accurate sales forecasting is critical for:
•	Demand planning
•	Inventory optimization
•	Pricing strategy
•	Promotion effectiveness evaluation
Traditional models often ignore controllable factors such as pricing and marketing campaigns.
This project addresses that gap.

Modeling Approach
The forecasting system combines:
-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
•	Captures temporal dependencies
•	Extracts seasonality patterns
•	Learns demand dynamics
-Random Forest (Stacked Layer)
•	Enhances nonlinear factor interactions
•	Improves predictive robustness

Data Processing
•	One-Hot Encoding of categorical variables
•	Feature scaling
•	Sliding time window (7-day sequences)
•	Multi-brand forecasting

Model Evaluation
Models evaluated using:
•	MAE
•	RMSE
•	R²

Comparison performed between LSTM and hybrid LSTM + Random Forest architecture.
Forecasting Capability
•	7-day forward sales prediction
•	Brand-level forecasting
•	Export of forecast results to Excel

Business Value
The project demonstrates how machine learning can support managerial decision-making by:
•	Quantifying promotion impact
•	Improving sales planning reliability
•	Supporting data-driven pricing strategy

Future Improvements
•	Time-series cross-validation
•	Gradient boosting models
•	Production deployment pipeline
•	Integration with BI dashboards
